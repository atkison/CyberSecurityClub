<b>Privacy</b><br>
https://privacy.com/ (How were they able to snag that domain name??)<br>
<b>Privacy</b> is a website that allows you to create debit cards, put money on them, and then use them on other sites like it was your own debit card. This means that you are only providing your debit card information to <b>Privacy</b> rather than a whole bunch of websites, including ones you are unsure whether or not they are safe but they are selling hand sanitizer bottles in the shape of a computer so you have to buy it!<br>
