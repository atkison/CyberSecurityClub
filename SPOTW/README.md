<b>Privacy</b><br>
https://privacy.com/ (How were they able to snag that domain name??)<br>
Privacy is a website that allows you to create virtual debit cards, put money on them, and then use them on other sites like it was your own debit card. This means that you are only providing your debit card information to Privacy rather than a whole bunch of websites. This can be beneficial for many reasons. For example, it can help if you are shopping on a website and you are unsure whether or not it is safe, but they are selling hand sanitizer bottles in the shape of a computer so you have to buy a couple! Create a virtual debit card on Privacy, put $5 on it, buy some computer shaped hand sanitizers, and if it turns out the website was a scam well then you can just... do nothing. The virtual card you used deleted automatically after the purchase and they don't have the information to your actual debit card so there's nothing to worry about!<br>
