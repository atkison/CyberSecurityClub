<br>

Crimson Defense was established with three main goals in mind:<br>
- Teach real Cyber Security that's applicable in the field (penetration testing, malware analysis, etc.)
- Bring together a group that advocates and promote the Cyber Security degree, major, and specialization within the Computer Science Department
- Compete in Cyber security competitions at the local, state, and national level

## <b>Meet the Crimson Defense H@ckers</b>
Everyone from begginer level to advanced are welcome and encouraged to join the competition team. It is a great opportunity to learn more about cyber security and really dive deep into what it takes to solve complex cyber security problems. The competition team is comprised of individuals motivated and driven to protect the world from any potential exploit or vulnerability. While both focused on hardening systems and pentesting systems to make sure they are as secure as they can be, the Crimson Defense H@ckers work tirelessly day in and day out. They are an elite security group and there isn't a problem too difficult for them to solve. Head over to the [Crimson Defense H@ckers](/Crimson_Defense_H@ckers) directory and meet the team! <br>
<br>

## <b>Before You Start!</b>
If you are looking to start solving your own challenges and learning about how to compete, if you do not already have a virtual machine set up to where you can solve these challenges go ahead and checkout the [Virtual Machines](Virtual_Machines) and follow the instructions on how to set up your own Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or Parrot OS virtual machine! <br>
<br>

## <b>Where do I even start?</b>
One of most puzzling things to figure out, especially when trying to start learning about Cyber Security. There is so much to learn, which is one of the reasons why it is so great. But with there being so much information out there it can be hard to figure out where to even begin. [This folder]((/0_Where_To_Start)) will help those brand new to Cyber Security. Individuals who have little to no experience and want to get started but don't know where to go. Hopefully the resources here will help you understand what Cyber Security is all about.<br>
<br>

## <b>How can I get a certification?</b> 
There are many certifications to choose from. Check out the [Security+](/Security+More) directory and see which one grabs your attention!<br>
<br>

## <b>CTF</b>
[Capture the flag]((/Skills)) events are a lot of fun. They test your skills across a variety topics. These topics include Forensics, Cryptography, Web Exploitation, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation, and more!<br> 

Checkout each individual CTF topic's directory and learn more about them and find out which tools you can be using right now to help you with solving CTF challenges!<br>
