# Code-Breaking and Decoding 

Having the ability to interpret and understand data even if it is presented in a different or unknown format is extremely important to conducting cyber security examinations and to the general understanding of cyber security. A coded message is simply a message that has been changed in some way so as to hide its meaning from prying eyes. <br>

There are many different ways to write the same information. Below is a Lookup Table that shows decimal, hex, octal, and html encodings for characters. There are other ways to encode messages, such as binary or Base 64, but these will give a good idea of how encoding works. <br>

The message “Let the games begin!” could be encoded as follows: <br>
Dec: 76 101 116 32 116 104 101 32 103 97 109 101 115 32 98 101 103 105 110 33 <br>
Hx: 4C 65 74 20 74 68 65 20 67 61 6D 65 73 20 62 65 67 69 6E 21 <br>
Oct: 114 145 164 040 164 150 145 040 147 141 155 145 163 040 142 145 147 151 156 041 <br>
Html: &#76 &#101 &#116 &#32 &#116 &#104 &#101 &#32 &#103 &#97 &#109 &#101 &#115 &#32 &#98 &#101 &#103 &#105 &#110 &#33 <br>
