# Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the process of extracting information or design knowledge from
anything that is man-made. The mechanisms within the field of reverse engineering are
used in many applications including understanding malware, bridging software
interoperability, and determining the strength of application code. <br>

Knowledge of the usage of a disassembler is helpful to solve reverse engineering tasks. A
disassembler is a tool that interprets a compiled program and produces the
corresponding machine code that can be used for analysis. There are several
disassemblers available including IDA and Ghidra (https://www.ghidra-sre.org). <br>

A free evaluation version of IDA can be found at the following link: <br>

Potential skills that may be necessary to solve reverse engineering tasks.
- Basic understanding of how binary data is read and structured
- How to programmatically read in binary data
- How to handle low-level reads and writes
- How to interpret raw data using a hexadecimal viewer
- Understanding how the stack and heap is used with applications

Below are potential examples of reverse engineering problems:
- Password discovery
- Breaking through obfuscation
- Discovering DLL Injection
- Discovering malware
