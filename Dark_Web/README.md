# The Dark Web

If you were able to attend the meeting in which we talked all about the internet ans the dark web then go ahead and download the resources here that will get you on to the dark web. There is also a text file with .onion URLs that we discussed during the meeting. If you did not attend the meeting then I reccommend you read what is below to get a decent understanding of how all of this works and what it means to access the dark web. <br>

## Resources
Link to download TOR browser:<br>
[TOR Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)<br>
<br>
Link to download TAILS. Follow the instructions on how to verify your downlaod:<br>
[TAILS](https://tails.boum.org/install/)<br>
<br>
For those curious, TAILS will help you become more anonymous if you are trying to be extra careful when on the dark web. I have TOR on my mac and I use it to access the dark web when I'm bored or want to access a specific site with a little more anonymity. <br>

## Google as a Browser
Google sells ads not only on their search engine, but also on over 2.2 million other websites and over 1 million apps. Every time you visit one of these sites or apps, Google is storing that information and using it to target ads at you. A quick alternative can be to switch to Firefox. Firefox keeps very little data on you and blocks third-partie's tracking cookies by default. Firefox is not watching you. <br>

## Google as a Search Engine
Search engines are your second gate keepers to the internet, right after your ISP. Google tweaks what and how results appear on the page, which changes how you think. Average users don't understand just how much google knows about them. It goes against what search engines are made for, providing organic search results. Organic search result is refferring to how all pages are indexed based on the search term and the content of the website alone and they are ranked according to how well these two parameters match. <br>

See for yourself. Go ahead and google "is google manipulating search results" on google.com and then search it again on another search engine such as duckduckgo.com and take a look at the difference. Google places content they want above the organic search results, making you scroll and making it more difficult to get to the organic results. <br>

## Incognito Mode
If you were wondering why ads still follow you around when you are in incognito mode it is because incognito mode only deletes your local search and browsing history, just the content on your computer. Websites, search engines, internet service providers, and governments can still easily track you accross the web. <br>

## Virtual Private Network 
VPNs, do you know what they really do?
