First script using subprocess instead of os to do system level commands. Was happy with how simple it was. 

The script brute forces each permutation of command arguments for when a specific order is needed but unkown

Given example was fragments of a binary that I simply brute forced each permutation as arguments to cat and then attempted to run each output
