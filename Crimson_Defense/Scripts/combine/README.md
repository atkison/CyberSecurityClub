Pretty handy wordlist generation tool. Takes a wordlist with individual words on each line and creates the full list of permutations of that list. Works well when you have a limited set of custom words but need more customization


Typically paired with john --wordlist --rules=(single/jumbo) --stdout > betterWordlist
