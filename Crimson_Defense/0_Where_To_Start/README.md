### <b>What is Cyber Securtiy?</b>
"Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These 
cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money 
from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Implementing effective cyber security measures is particularly challenging today because there are more 
devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative." - CISCO<br>
