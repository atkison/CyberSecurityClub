# Meet the Crimson Defense H@ckers
For a team that lives in the deep dark corners of the dark web, The Crimson Defense H@ckers really do know how to hide. After quite a long time of tracking them down I got them all to give a description of who they are and how they got into hacking. They keep their true identity sacred, so the following information might not be accurate. There is a risk to putting your personal information out on the surface web, especially for an elite security team such as this one. There might be some truth to these but since I can't be certain of it, I'll leave that up for you to decide. <br>

## The Team

I am an old white lady who loves to eat chocolate, but only if it's a Hersheys "giant" bar. The other ones just aren't as good. I started hacking in my early 60s, I want to say 63 but I could be wrong; It was so many years ago. It all started when I was at a Chinese restaurant and I opened up my fortune cookie and it said "you will be pwned in the near future". I immediately went home to my Ubuntu machine and starting securing the heck out of it. I don't know where I learned all the commands to be honest, they just came to me naturally. I spent 1000 hours, without getting up, making sure my system was as secure as it can be. A few days later I was pwned. I have since then spent every day practicing my security hardening skills and have never eaten at another Chinese restaurant again.<br>
