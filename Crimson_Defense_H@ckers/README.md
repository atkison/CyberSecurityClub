# Meet the Crimson Defense H@ckers
For a team that lives in the deep dark corners of the dark web, The Crimson Defense H@ckers really do know how to hide. After quite a long time of tracking them down I got them all to give a description of who they are and how they got into hacking. They keep their true identity sacred, so the following information might not be accurate. There is a risk to putting your personal information out on the surface web, especially for an elite security team such as this one. There might be some truth to these but since I can't be certain of it, I'll leave that up for you to decide. <br>
