<b>Python</b> <br>
"When it comes to solving capture the flag challenges there are many great tools that you can use, some of which might already be downloaded on your pentesting machine! If not, you can find many great tools to download online. However, there are going to be times where the tools that you have at your disposal are almost what you need but not exactly what you need. If you ever get to this point, you should never give up. You just need to find another way to solve the problem and Python just might be your answer. Python is great for writing scripts quickly and effeciently. With Python, you can do almost anything. You can use Python to create scripts to solve an array of problems including password cracking, web exploitation, and many more." <br>

<b>Nmap</b> <br>
"Using the command ifconfig you can get the rage of your network and once you do that you can then use Nmap to discover other machines. If there is a target machine in the network range, you can use Nmap to discover the machine’s IP address. Similar tools include netdiscover and ARP. Using these two tools first can allow you to narrow down the target machine and you can then use Nmap along with these two commands to get the information you need about the target machine. The command –sS will tell Nmap to look for open ports and services and the command –AT4 looks for OS information, which can tell you a lot about your target machine." <br>
