Every week someone from the competition team will look into a tool used for solving CTF challenges. A breif presentation will be given about the tool and a write up consisting of only a few sentences will be presented as well.

Nmap <br>
"Using the command ifconfig you can get the rage of your network and once you do that you can then use Nmap to discover other machines. If there is a target machine in the network range, you can use Nmap to discover the machine’s IP address. Similar tools include netdiscover and ARP. Using these two tools first can allow you to narrow down the target machine and you can then use Nmap along with these two commands to get the information you need about the target machine. The command –sS will tell Nmap to look for open ports and services and the command –AT4 looks for OS information, which can tell you a lot about your target machine." <br>
